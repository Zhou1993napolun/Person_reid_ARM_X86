_Steps to run Reid person enabler on x86 device._

## 1. Download Weight File
Download `checkpoint.rar` from one of the two address below: 

[Baidu Netdisk] https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ZI_UVUsPC9NKPFmjyF4MiQ  
Password: 1234

## 2. Unzip
Unzip it under `deep_sort/deep/`. 

## 3. Create Conda Environment
> Python version is 3.7 in our tests. Creating a new environment is recommended. 
```sh
conda create -n [NEW_ENVIRONMENT] python=3.7
# Enter y to confirm
conda activate [NEW_ENVIRONMENT]
```

## 4. Install Requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you encounter errors similar to this:
```sh
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement **** (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for ****
```
This means pip cannot find the package on the mirror site in your environment settings. Please check the installation source settings or install the mentioned package seperately: 
```sh
pip install **** -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```
If you encounter `socket.timeout`, please retry later with better internet connections.  

## 5. Corrections For Torch
This model is based on yolov5, you may encouter the following error: 
```sh
AttributeError: 'Upsample' object has no attribute 'recompute_scale_factor'
```
This may be caused by imcompability between different torch versions. We can simply solve this problem by modifying the file `upsampling.py`: 
```sh
vim [YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/upsampling.py
```
In line 156 and 157, remove the unwanted parameter:
```python
        return F.interpolate(input, self.size, self.scale_factor, self.mode, self.align_corners)
                             # recompute_scale_factor=self.recompute_scale_factor)
```
Save and quit after modification. 

## 6. Prepare Test Image / Video / Webcam 
We did not provide a test video in this package.

## 7. Run File `person_count.py`

### Run with video input
Run directly by: 
```sh
python3 person_count.py --input_path '[YOUR_VIDEO_PATH]'
```
The accuracy is improved in `reid_improved.py`, it can be tested by: 
```sh
python3 reid_improved.py --input_path '[YOUR_VIDEO_PATH]'
```

### Run with image input
Argument `--img` needs to appear in order to run test on a image input:
```sh
python3 person_count.py --input_path '[YOUR_IMAGE_PATH]' --img
```
Or with the improved method: 
```sh
python3 reid_improved.py --input_path '[YOUR_IMAGE_PATH]' --img
```

### Run with ip cam input
Argument `--ipcam` is needed. Specify the ip address of the input camera by the argument `--input_path`. 
```sh 
python3 person_count.py --input_path '[CAMERA_IP_ADDRESS]' --ipcam
```
Or with the improved method: 
```sh
python3 reid_improved.py --input_path '[CAMERA_IP_ADDRESS]' --ipcam
```
Once started, a blanck image window will pop up. There will be command line outputs to check the program's current status. To stop the program, click on the blanck image window and press q. There may be a short lag which is normal. The output will be stored in `output/`. 

### Improvements of the result
With any of the above files, use `--help` to see supported arguments.  
Specially, if different persons are not being well distinguished, you may run the improved method with the argument `--id_thres`. Larger threshold is recommended for crowded scenes.   
If the count is much larger than the number of persons, you may run with a higher confidence threshold by specifying the argument `--conf-thres`.
